# Bounce Rate User Engagement Analysis

# Project Objective and Introduction

In this project, I analyze the user engagement dataset to gain insights into user engagement and identify factors that contribute to a high or low bounce rate. Also, to make informed decision-making processes aimed at enhancing user experience, optimizing user behavior and preferences, and improving customer retention rates.


# Importing Essential Python Libraries and Datasets

In this section, I've imported essential Python libraries and the dataset, laying the foundation for my analysis. This initial setup is pivotal as it paves the way for the comprehensive exploration ahead. The key Python libraries employed will be Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

# Data Source
The dataset is from a Kaggle and contains information about the bounce rate, session duration, and other features of website users

# Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Pre-Processing 
In order to comprehend the dataset I’m handling, I engage in data exploration and pre-processing. 
 
This involves:

1.	Checking for null values in the dataset.
2.	Understanding the dataset columns and examining their data types.
3.	Converting the 'Avg. Session Duration' and 'Bounce Rate' columns for further analysis.
4.	Checking the correlation matrix between the columns

# Data Analysis and Visualization

Here, I analyzed the bounce rates to understand the percentage of users who visit a website or webpage but leave without taking any further action or navigating to other pages within the same site and the user retention rates by calculating the number of users the platform has retained so far. 

# Bounce Rate Analysis

Here, I started by creating bounce rate segments, then;

1.	Analyzing the number of users in each segment.
2.	Analyzing the average session duration of the users in each bounce rate segment.
3.	Analyzing the top 10 loyal users according to the number of sessions and average session duration
4.	Analyzing the relationship between the average session duration and the bounce rates

From the above analysis, I discovered that;

1.	Users with low bounce rates have an average session duration of about 9.05 minutes on the website, while users with high bounce rates have an average session duration of only 1.43 minutes.
2.	There is a negative linear relationship between the average session duration and bounce rates (which is ideal here). It means a high number of average session duration results in lower bounce rates.

# User Retention Analysis


Here, I started by creating a retention segment based on the number of sessions, and then;

1.	Analyzing the average bounce rate by retention segment.
2.	Analyzing the percentage of retained users.

From the above analysis, I discovered that;

1.	There’s not much difference between the average bounce rates of frequent and occasional users.
2.	In the data of 1000 users, the platform retained 29.7% of users (297 users) who frequently visit the platform.
